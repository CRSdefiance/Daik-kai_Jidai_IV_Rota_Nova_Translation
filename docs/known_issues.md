## Naming keyboard page selection

The naming popup still opens on the Japanese kana page. The visible `英` and `記`
entries are not ordinary captions: the keyboard manager also uses their exact encoded
values to identify the Latin and symbol pages. Replacing either value makes the
corresponding page render as a blank black panel.

For stability, the current build keeps those two functional identifiers unchanged.
The editor headings use direct translations such as `Name: Edit`; they no longer
contain instructions to press `英`.

Making Latin input the default remains a code-level task. It requires locating and
changing the keyboard manager's initial page index without modifying its page
identifiers. Until then, select `英` to reach the built-in Latin keyboard.
